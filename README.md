# e-commerce site

This is a project based on a Udemy course, created by Yihua Zhang (https://github.com/ZhangMYihua). I've used it as an initial template and I'm making some improvements.

## Improvements I've made:

âœ¨ Using TypeScript\
âœ¨ Multi-Language Support (English and Farsi)\
âœ¨ Path Aliases\
âœ¨ Replacing Class Components With Their Functional Counterparts\

## To Do:

ðŸ—“ Dark Mode\
ðŸ—“ Not Found Pages\
